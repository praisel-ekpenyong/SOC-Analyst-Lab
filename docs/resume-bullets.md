# Resume Bullets

These 6 resume bullets are based on lab work and simulated incidents in this portfolio. They are framed as skill demonstrations — **not claims of employment**.

> **Usage note:** When adding these to a resume under a portfolio or projects section, frame them as: *"IT Support Home Lab Portfolio (self-directed)"*

## 6 Resume Bullets

1. **Deployed and administered Active Directory** in a Windows Server 2019 lab environment: created OUs, users, groups, GPOs (password and lockout policy), and SMB file shares; practiced DNS troubleshooting and domain client onboarding.

2. **Resolved simulated help desk incidents** including account lockouts (6 users), domain-wide DNS failure (47 workstations), printer driver regression, and critical disk space depletion — documenting root cause analysis, fix procedures, and user communications for each.

3. **Managed end-to-end ticket lifecycle** in osTicket: configured departments, agents, SLA plans, and canned responses; created, triaged, and closed 12 sample tickets covering password resets, network issues, hardware, software, and user onboarding.

4. **Authored three IT support PowerShell scripts** — disk space reporting, event log export, and local password reset — with parameter handling, error checking, and safety warnings suitable for Tier 1 deployment.

5. **Diagnosed and resolved network connectivity failures** using `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, and `nslookup`; identified a DNS forwarder misconfiguration on a domain controller that caused internet and login failures across all workstations.

6. **Performed Windows troubleshooting** using Event Viewer, SFC, DISM, and Print Management; cleared stuck print spooler queues, rolled back incompatible driver updates, repaired Windows Update component failures, and optimized startup configuration.
